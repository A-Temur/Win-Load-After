# Startup Load Order Customizer

## Overview
Startup Load Order Customizer is a Windows application designed to manage and customize the order in which executables load upon system startup. This tool is especially useful for ensuring that sensitive software, such as Razer Synapse, loads in an environment optimized for its operationâ€”potentially after other critical services like motherboard software have initialized.

## Features
- **Customizable Load Order:** Set the exact order you want your applications to start when Windows boots up.
- **Delayed Start:** Introduce a delay between the start of applications to avoid conflicts.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily configure your startup settings with a simple and intuitive interface.
- **Profile Management:** Save different profiles for various configurations, making it easy to switch between custom setups.
